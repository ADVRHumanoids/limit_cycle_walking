/**
 * this walker is conceived having in mind a 'normal walk':
 * while walking I'm not thinking at each step, but only at a general direction.
 * Hence, I'm treating the robot as a point (represented by the com), and I'm giving a direction to this point.
 * Footsteps are planned accordingly.
 * (Sometimes it can be the opposite: I may be more interested in a specific stepping motion while not thinking about
 * the center of mass motion. This makes me think that there are three parameters:
 * 1. general idea of motion
 * 2. com motion
 * 3. step motion
 * Can I assume that the general idea of motion coincides with the sagittal com, since our 'principal component of motion'
 * is in the sagittal plane?
